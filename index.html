            <p>My Favorite Hobby is reading books. I read books in my freetime. I love to read beacuse you learn to understand people, you learn to stay calm, you become intelligent and smart, you improve your communication and vocabulary, increase your confidence level, you learn from mentors how to deal with problems and obstacles and move towards the journey of success</p>
